# Testing stuff

You need npm obviusly for this project to work.

Do "npm install" to get all dev dependencies to get installed.

Then you can run the express server with the command "node server.js". It will create an instance on localhost:3000 or 127.0.0.1:3000 whatever you prefer.

In order to Build the assets on "src" folder you just run:

gulp

You will get styles and Javascript compiled with Babel outputted to the core/static folder.

Run "npm test" to run test over specs files and the wdio config file. This will write the reports generated by junit (ready to work with Jenkins) on the "/test/reports" folder.

The sample project consist of a SPA app only with ES6 that let user register and login and use LocalStorage to save some auth settings.
